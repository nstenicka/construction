		<h1>What Aberfeldy means..</h1>
		<p>To John, Aberfeldy is a link between the old and the new. Aberfeldy is a burgh in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, on the River Tay. A small market town. It holds a lot of history to the family. To John's mother, in wartime Scotland as a young lass, Aberfeldy was to be a secure, safe and peaceful place away from the potential dangers and hardships of 1940. 
		<br>
		"Aberfeldy…While I was a young school girl, my sister and I were evacuated to a safe location away from the suspected landing zone of the fierce German paratroopers in 1940-Aberfeldy.
	    While just a single week of my life, I hold strong clear family memories from Aberfeldy.  As an 11 year old, I waved and kissed my father for the last time and was the end of my childhood…Some 50 years later, I returned with my sister for a vacation together.  The town, like the two of us, had changed in many ways.  Aberfeldy was to be our last vacation together in our beloved Scotland.” 
		-Kathleen Stenicka 
		The homes we design and build at Aberfeldy Home Construction are secure, safe, warm sanctuaries for families to enjoy and add memories here on Florida's beautiful Gulf Coast.
